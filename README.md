**Data analyst simulator is an internship in a company, its product is a mobile application with a news feed and messenger. I work as a data analyst and create all analytics from scratch.**


First, based on the database, I need to create dashboards and answer the questions "how much" and "when".

Now I move on to more complex analytics and answer more complex questions, the causes of anomalies, and calculate complex metrics.

Having built visual analytics for myself and my colleagues, I move on to solving applied problems. There are 4 groups hashed with salt, and with them I need to first the AA testing, then the AB testing and answer business questions about the feasibility of innovations.
