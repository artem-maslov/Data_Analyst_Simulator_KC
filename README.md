**Data analyst simulator is an internship in a company, its product is a mobile application with a news feed and messages. I work as a data analyst and create all analytics from scratch.**


First, based on the database, I need to create dashboards and answer the questions "how much" and "when".

Now you can move on to more complex analytics and answer more complex questions, the causes of anomalies, and calculate complex metrics.

Having built visual analytics for yourself and your colleagues, you can move on to solving applied problems. There are 4 groups hashed with salt, and with them you need to forgive first the AA test, then the AB tests and answer business questions about the feasibility of innovations.

Now there is a task to automate the unloading of the table daily and at a certain time.

Next, I move on to automation and create daily reports on key metrics.

Finally, I also automate the process of finding anomalies and sending the alert system.

In my free time from the internship, I solve additional tasks on statistics.
